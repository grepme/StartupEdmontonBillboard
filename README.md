Startup Edmonton Billboard
==========================

Welcome to the billboard that runs on the touch screen at Startup Edmonton!

It lists events by day and let's you interact with them for more information. 

It displays the name of the event, the location in the office, and the time it is being conducted. All imported
from Google Calendar.

It updates every 10 seconds for informative information on events going on.

The goal is to build an interactive medium with touch features that can communicate to members what's going on.
It is currently in Beta and is expected to grow in size and modules. This was a simple hack project done in several
hours to originally run on a Raspberry Pi.
